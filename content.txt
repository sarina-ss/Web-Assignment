We know it has been a rough year. First year wasn't the way it was supposed to be. Everyone is tired of zoom classes, social distancing and sad news.  In a silly attempt to bring some light into the world, CS1033 students have created this website, which serves 2 purposes:
-1. To help CS1033 students learn how to create a website.
-2. To shine some light on a rough year.

WESTERN RESEARCH PAGE CONTENT
********************************************************
Western University has professors, graduate students and undergraduate students tackling the COVID crisis on many fronts. Here are just a few of Western's COVID research projects:

Computer Science and Stats Professor Dr. Grace Yi and her colleagues create a tool to help visualize COVID data across Canada.

Computer Science Professor Dr. Anwar Haque and a team of computer scientists do a digital deep dive in order to test the privacy thresholds and effectiveness of contract tracing mobile apps. 

Epidemiologist Dr. Saverio Stranges investigates spread of the disease, trying to determine why some countries have been able to successfully manage the COVID outbreak but other countries have seen rapid increases in the number of cases. His results will be helpful in curbing the spread of future outbreaks. 

Computer Science lecturers Bryan Sarlo and Laura Reid feeble attempt to bring some lightness to a heavy world by having their students create a website about the pandemic but with a more hopeful tone.
